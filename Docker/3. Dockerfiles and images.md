Dockerfile is a file type which is read by docker to build an image.

- If a project just has one dockerfile, it'll usually be called exactly "Dockerfile" and will be in the root, if you don't specify a dockerfile when you try to build, docker will look for a file called "Dockerfile" in the [[Build context|build context]] (which we'll get to later).
- You can also name them whatever you want with .dockerfile appended. Eg "myProject.dockerfile"




The concept of an "image" can confusing. An image can be very tiny (like 5 KB) or massive (containing an entire monolithic application).

The important thing to understand is that the image contains **everything** your application needs to run as a container - including all your code; when you create an image you will literally copy your whole codebase into your image.
