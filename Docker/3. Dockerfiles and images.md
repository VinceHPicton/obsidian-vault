The concept of an "image" can confusing. An image can be very tiny (like 5 KB) or massive (containing an entire monolithic application).

The important thing to understand is that the image contains **everything** your application needs to run as a container - including all your code; when you create an image you will literally copy your whole codebase into your image.
