Knowing how to use docker in your day-to-day means knowing how to use 3 key things: Dockerfile, the docker cli, and docker compose. 

1. [[3. Dockerfiles|Dockerfiles]] are a simply file type which are read by docker to define building a docker image.

2. The docker cli allows you to tell docker to do things, like build an image from a dockerfile, run an image (which creates a container), execute a command against a container, and much more. 
	- You can run `docker --help` to see everything you can do, but the really important commands to get you started are `docker run`, `build`, and `exec`

3. docker compose basically lets you define how a whole stack of containers should be built and run as a group, all in 1 file, it's main purpose is to simplify and codify what would otherwise require running a whole bunch of docker cli commands.


To understand docker itself, you only need to understand Dockerfiles and the some core docker cli commands, so that's what we'll focus on first.
