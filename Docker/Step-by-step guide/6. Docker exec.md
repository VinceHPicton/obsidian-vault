You should now understand to a reasonable level what a Dockerfile does, how it works, and you know some of the core Docker CLI commands like build and run.

The final trick I think you need to know to say you've got the very basics of Docker is how to run commands against *already running* containers. This is done with `docker exec` and you'll mostly be using it to connect to a container and investigate what's happening inside it.
