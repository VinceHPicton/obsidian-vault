In practice, I quite rarely use these commands because docker compose is usually running them for me, but I'm just going to touch on them here so you understand what a stopped container is.

As you can imagine, `docker start` and `docker stop` start and stop a container. You can pass them a container ID (abbreviated to the first 3 chars will work), or a name, which are random strings like "modest_perlman" which docker gives all containers. You can't change the command that was given in `docker run`.

Obviously, if you delete and recreate a container, you lose any state you might've changed in that container, and it's a lot faster to stop and start a container than delete and recreate it, but in practice you'll usually be creating fresh containers  with docker run.

It's important to think of containers as fairly fleeting things, you shouldn't be making any changes to the files in a container which you expect to keep, as you'll very often need to just completely destroy all your containers and rebuild them.


Have a quick play with start and stop if you like, there's not much to see.
