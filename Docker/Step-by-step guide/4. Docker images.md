If you've been following, you have just built your first image named "my-first-image:latest"
Now run the command:
`docker run my-first-image:latest ./my-go-binary`

You'll see that it outputted "Hello, World!" so what exactly just happened?

- Docker created a **container** based on your image.
- It then executed the command you gave (the 2nd arg) "./my-go-binary" in that container





The concept of an "image" can confusing. An image can be very tiny (like 5 KB) or massive (containing an entire monolithic application).

The important thing to understand is that the image contains **everything** your application needs to run as a container - including all your code; when you create an image you will literally copy your whole codebase into your image.


I would encourage you to comment out line 3 and build with just the first 2 lines, to see how the image building process has progressed at that point (this is generally a good trick to building or editing a dockerfile)
