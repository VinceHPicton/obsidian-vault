Remember at the start, I said that knowing docker means understanding Dockerfiles, the docker CLI, and docker compose, but only the first 2 are necessary to know the basics. 

Well now hopefully you do have a solid understanding of the of those first 2, meaning you have a strong grasp of the core concepts and are ready for some intermediate things.

Some very useful tips with the CLI:
- You can run docker --help to see all the options, rely on help to jog your memory, I still use it a lot
- The main commands are listed as "common commands" if you run --help, and even within those, the main ones to know are **build**, **run**, and **exec**
- You can also run "docker XX --help" to see the help for that specific command, eg `docker build --help`
- You can generally always add "rm" (remove), "ls" (list), wherever it makes sense. Eg "docker image ls" "docker container rm"

Time savers:
- You can add more than one ID/name separated by a space to commands like rm and stop/start: eg "docker start great_booth modest_perlman" to apply the command to multiple things.
- You can force things (usually deletions) with -f, like if you want to kill an image and dont care that you'll also kill all it's stopped containers. `docker image rm -f c91`
- You can do this to apply things to all image IDs that exist: `docker stop $(docker container ls -aq)`
	- -aq = -a + -q
	- -a is all, -q is quiet, which gives you just the IDs
- Use prune and prune -a to clean up, eg docker image prune
