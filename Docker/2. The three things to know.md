Knowing how to use docker means knowing how 3 key things: Dockerfile, the docker cli, and docker compose, but initially when learning, you only need to understand Dockerfiles and the core docker cli commands.

1. [[3. Dockerfiles and images|Dockerfiles]] are a simply file type which are read by docker to define building a docker image.

2. The docker cli allows you to tell docker to do things, like build an image from a dockerfile, run an image (which creates a container), execute a command against a container, and much more. 
	- You can run `docker --help` to see everything you can do, but the really important commands to get you started are `docker run`, `build`, and `exec`

3. docker compose basically lets you define how a whole stack of containers should run together, **you don't need to think about this until you're comfortable with the first 2**, as it's main purpose is to simplify and codify what would otherwise require running a whole bunch of docker cli commands.
