- Docker is software which lets you package your applications into "images" and then run those images as "containers"
- Any image can be run by any computer that has the docker software installed - it "just works"
- Think of the difference between this scenario and trying to run your colleagues code on your machine, only to find for some reason you get errors and they do not.
