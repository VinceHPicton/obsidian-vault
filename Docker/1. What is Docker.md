- Docker is software which lets you package your applications into "images" and then run those images as "containers"
- Any image can be run by any computer that has the docker software installed - it "just works"
- Think of the difference between this scenario and trying to run your colleagues code on your machine, only to find for some reason you get errors and they do not.

The concept of an "image" can confusing. An image can be very tiny (like 5 KB) or massive (containing an entire monolithic application).

The important thing to understand is that the image contains **everything** your application needs to run as a container - including all your code; when you create an image you will literally copy your whole codebase into your image.
