Content delivery networks are geographically distributed networks of servers used to deliver web content to users more efficiently, by caching content at an edge server nearest the user.

The primary goal of the CDN is to **reduce latency**, they also reduce load on the main server.

In a CDN there is an origin server, and many edge servers, edge servers cache content from the origin when they forward a request to the origin.
