You tell the system what should be done, you define the end result, and the technology works out how to do that, you don't need to define each step on the way, like writing terraform that says "give me an ec2 t2.micro instance in a VPC with an RDS database" or using react to create an element like"

rootElement.render(
<h1 className="header">Hello, React!</h1>
)
