You define each and every step of how to complete a task, like writing a bash script to spin up each aws service using the aws cli, or vanilla JS to create an element line by line:

const h1 = document.createElement("h1")
h1.textContent = "This is imperative coding"
h1.className = "header"
document.getElementById("root").appendChild(h1)
