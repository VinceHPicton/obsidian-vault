At its simplest, runtime refers to the time when your code is actually running, rather than compiling or being written.

"**Runtime complexity**" refers to the big O complexity of a program.

"**Runtime environment**" refers to the broader ecosystem (environment) that the code runs in, for example node.js is a runtime environment that runs JavaScript outside of a browser.
