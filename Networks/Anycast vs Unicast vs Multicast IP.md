Unicast IP. = 1 globally unique IP for your server

Anycast IP = 1 IP routes to many different servers, and the internet sends the request to **whichever is closest**.

A **multicast IP** is a special type of IP address used to send data to multiple devices (hosts) simultaneously, rather than just one (unicast) or all (broadcast).
