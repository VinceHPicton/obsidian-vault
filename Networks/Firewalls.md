Firewalls are basically like an airport security for incoming and outgoing packets, they can be software or a physical device like the above.
They can dynamically change their own security in response to threats.
They inspect incoming requests and either block or allow them according to set rules (eg correct IP address and port)
They can also inspect packet data to scan for malicious data.
