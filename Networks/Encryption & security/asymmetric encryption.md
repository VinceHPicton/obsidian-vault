The process where data is encrypted using a key pair - a sharable public and a secret private key, to securely transfer data.

Data can be encrypted with the public key, but can only be decrypted by the private key. The public key can be given out, but the private key is held only by the key pair holder.

The public key is given out to computers wishing to send a secure message to the provider, they use it encrypt their message, and then send the message to the provider, who can then use the private key to decrypt it.
