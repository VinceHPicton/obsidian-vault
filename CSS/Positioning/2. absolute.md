If you set an element with `position: absolute;` it is **removed from the DOM entirely**. Other elements will not make space for it, and will behave as if it doesn't exist at all.
This can mean it's displayed ontop of or behind other things.

You can position an absolute element with the top/bottom and left/right properties
You cannot use top AND bottom or left AND right on the same class, if you do 1 will be ignored
```
.item {
	position: absolute;
	top: 0px;
	right -50px;
}
```
You can set negative values to push the element partially out of the page entirely, allowing you to display half an image for example.

**The way it works is**
- An element with `position: absolute` is positioned relative to the nearest ancestor which has a position attribute (other than static). 
- If/when it does find one, it positions itself relative to that element.
- If an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
