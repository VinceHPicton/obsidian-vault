An element with `position: sticky;` is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

A sticky element toggles between `relative` and `fixed`, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).

The result is that it will get pulled down its container with the top of the window, until it hits the bottom of its container (or its defined bottom limit), after which it will begin to cut off as you scroll down further.
