Fixed behaves similarly to absolute - **removing the element from the DOM entirely** - except it positions relative to the HTML (top level parent) element, instead of the nearest ancestor which has a position attribute (other than static). 

It is also fixed on the screen when you scroll around, making it useful for a fixed toolbar for example.

CSS to make you a header!
```
.header {
	position: fixed;
	top: 0px; /* replace wit bottom: 0px for footer! */
	left: 0px;
	width: 100%;
	z-index: 1; /* Puts it ontop */
}
```
