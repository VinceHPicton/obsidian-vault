These 4 properties are applied to the **direct children** of the container (the thing that has display: flex on it) directly.

**flex-grow**
- Used for positive space allocation. Children that have this property expand along the main axis as much as they can **without squashing other children**. 
- The default (flex-grow: 0) is the same as omitting the property entirely (unless overriding)
- If there is a number (flex-grow: 2) this corresponds to the ratio of space it will take up relative to other children with a flex-grow.
- Children without the property (or it set to 0), will stay their normal size but get pushed to the edge.

**flex-shrink**
- Used to allow certain items to shrink as a priority over others **if there is not enough space**
- Default: 1
- If set to **zero** item will **refuse to shrink at all** 

{ flex-shrink:Â 3; } = Let the item shrink **up to** three times more than the rest

**flex-basis**
- Sets the size of an item before the remaining space is distributed
- Used to overwrite the previously assigned size of an item.
- Default: auto
- flex-basis: 0 shrinks it to the max

**eg flex-basis: 300px**

**flex**
- This is a short hand for all 3 of the before: flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis
- flex:     flex-grow      flex-shrink     flex-basis;
- **Default** 
	- flex: 0 1 auto
