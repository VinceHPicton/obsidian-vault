The default main axis is the horizontal left to right. `flex-direction: row;` sets this, but is redundant unless using it to override another flex-direction.
The default cross axis is vertical, top to bottom

**flex-direction**
flex-direction dictates which access is the main access, and its direction. Whatever the main is, the **other one will be the cross axis**.
`flex-direction: column;`
to change the main axis to the **vertical** axis

There is also:
`flex-direction: column-reverse;`
and
`flex-direction: row-reverse;`
Which **invert the direction**
