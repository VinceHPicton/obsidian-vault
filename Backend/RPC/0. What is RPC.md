RPC = remote procedure call

Rather than a client saying "POST to /users/123" with JSON {"name": "Vince"} it says:
Call function createUser() with input "name = vince"

Under the hood it's a network request over HTTP, just like REST, but for the developer it *feels like* calling a function on the server directly, rather than building a HTTP request and sending it.

RPC typically (overwhelmingly) uses protobuf, rather than JSON
