A **React Hook** is a **function** that lets you **use state and lifecycle features** in **functional components**.

Hooks start with the word **"use"** (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) and allow you to:

- Manage **state** (`useState`)
- Handle **side effects** (`useEffect`)
- Access **context** (`useContext`)
- And many more 

Custom hooks are just **regular JavaScript functions** that start with **`use`** and internally use other hooks.
