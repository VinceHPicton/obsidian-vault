This further cleans up code so a component using the useContext doesnt have to concern itself with importing the React Context object.

**All this really changes is the fact you dont have to pass an argument to useContext, you just use useXXX - eg useTasks() - instead**

So this messier code:
```
const NavBar = () => {
  const { tasks, dispatch } = useContext(TasksContext);

  return (
    <nav>
      <span>{tasks.length}</span>
    </nav>
  );
};
```
Becomes this slightly cleaner code:
```
const NavBar = () => {
  const { tasks, dispatch } = useTasks();

  return (
    <nav>
      <span>{tasks.length}</span>
    </nav>
  );
};
```

**Hook definition**
```
const useTasks = () => useContext(TasksContext);

export default useTasks;
```
