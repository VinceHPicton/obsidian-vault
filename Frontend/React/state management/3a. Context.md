Context allows you to share state down the entire component tree from where you wrap elements. Avoiding the need to manually pass state down and down the layers (called state drilling)

**How to create a new context**
1. Lift the state up to the nearest parent above the components where it's needed - eg to the App component if state was needed by both the Navbar and the main page
2. Create a context file for the state:
```
interface TasksContextType {
  tasks: Task[];
  dispatch: Dispatch<TaskAction>;
}

// {} as TasksContextType avoids need for having | null in the <>
const TasksContext = React.createContext<TasksContextType>(
  {} as TasksContextType
);

export default TasksContext;
```
3. Wrap component tree using a Provider component, like this:
```
function App() {
  const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(taskReducer, []);
  
  return (
    <TasksContext.Provider value={{ tasks, dispatch }}>
      <NavBar></NavBar>
      <HomePage></HomePage>
    </TasksContext.Provider>
  );
}
```
4. This **enables** you to use the useContext hook to access the state in value anywhere down the tree:
```
const NavBar = () => {
  const { tasks, dispatch } = useContext(TasksContext);

  return (
    <nav>
      <span>{tasks.length}</span>
    </nav>
  );
};
```
