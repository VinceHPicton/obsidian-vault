Reducers is basically used *reduce* the possible ways you can update a piece of state. This makes the code:
- More readable
- Less prone to bugs - since state can't change in an unexpected way

How it works: take the following code which uses useState
```
const UseReducerExample = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
      <div>Count: {count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
We are able to use `setCount` to set the `count` to any value, when really it only makes sense to increment it or reset it.
Let's change it to a reducer...

In /reducers/countReducer.ts:
```
interface Action {
  type: "INCREMENT" | "RESET";
}

const countReducer = (currentState: number, action: Action): number => {
  if (action.type === "INCREMENT") return currentState + 1;
  if (action.type === "RESET") return 0;
  return currentState;
};
```
We define a reducer function, this defines the possible changes that can happen to the count.

And are component becomes:
```
import React, { useReducer } from "react";
import countReducer from "../reducers/countReducer";

const UseReducerExample = () => {
  const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(countReducer, 0);

  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
      <div>Count: {count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "RESET" })}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
