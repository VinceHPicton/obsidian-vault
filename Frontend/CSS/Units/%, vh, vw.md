% are relative to the size of the parent element.

This means section will take up 80% the width of its parent.
```
.section {
	width: 80%
}
```


**vw**
viewport width.
80vw corresponds to 80% of the viewport width

**vh**
viewport height.
80vh corresponds to 80% of the viewport height

Use % when you want to size relative to parent, and vw/vh when you want to size relative to the viewport.
