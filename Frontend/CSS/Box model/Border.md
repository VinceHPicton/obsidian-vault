`border: thickness type color`
(type = solid, dotted, dashed, inset, outset etc)

eg
`border: 5px solid black`

Whether it makes the element expand depends on `box-sizing` as explained in [[Padding]].
- `box-sizing: content-box` (default) means it **will** expand element
- `box-sizing: border-box` means it will instead shrink content.
