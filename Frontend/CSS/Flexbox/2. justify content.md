justify-content added to the **container css** dictates **how items are aligned** along the **MAIN** axis.

```
.container {
	display: flex;
	justify-content: center;
}
```

The options are:
- **flex-start** (the default) - pushes items to the start of the axis without spacing

- **flex-end** - pushes items to the end of the axis without spacing
![[Justify content flex-end.png|400]]
- **center** - bunches items in the center (USA spelling)
![[Justify content center.png|400]]
- **space-between** - puts even space between items, first and last item will be touching the start and end of the axis
![[Justify content space-between.png|400]]
- **space-around** - puts equal space to the left and right of **all** items, so that the left and right also have space separating them from the axis walls

- **space-evenly** - evenly spaced along axis including the end and start
