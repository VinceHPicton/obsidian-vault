**How policies are applied**
- Policies can be attached to individual users - called **inline policies**, or groups.
- So a user can inherit policies from any of its groups or its inline ones.

**What a policy consists of**
- Version - this is the language version for the policy itself
- ID - unique identifier
- Statements - array of permissions applied by policy

**So what's in a statement?**
- **Sid** (optional) - an ID for the statement
- **Effect** - Allow or Deny
- **Principal** (Required in some circumstances) - If you create a resource-based policy, you must define which user/group/role you want to allow/deny access of that resource to. If the IAM policy is attached to a user or role directly you **cannot include this element** (for obvious reasons).
- **Condition** (optional) - applies conditions to whether permission is applied
- **Resource** (Required in some circumstances) - array of resources effected by the action, if the policy is directly attached to a resource this may not be required.
- **Action** - the actual list of actions applied to the resource that the policy allows/denies
	- Note that it's possible to do an action wildcard like `"iam:Get*"` which will provide access to any API call starting with `iam:Get`
