This is a feature attached to a VPC which allows instances in a private subnet to make initiate connections to the internet, while blocking any internet traffic for initiating a connection. 

It is **only for IPv6 addresses**, and the end result it achieves is just like a [[8. NAT Gateways|NAT GWY]] for IPv4.

Obviously the subnet route table has to define routes to the egress only gwy.

You can route traffic where destination is both IPv4 and IPv6:
