Traffic mirroring allows you to copy network traffic and route to copies to some other target for inspection. This is for **security**.
This is different to [[12. VPC Flow logs]] which are able to watch traffic between instances within a VPC.

- You capture traffic from a **source** [[ENI (Elastic network Interface)]] and send it to a **target** which can be an ENI or [[Network load balancer (NLB)|NLB]] for inspection, threat monitoring etc.
- The source and target can only be in a different VPC if VPC peering is enabled.
- You can optionally filter which packets are sent to the target.
