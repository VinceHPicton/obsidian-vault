This is the same thing as AWS PrivateLink

VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) are a way to connect your VPC to other services outside it **within the same region** via the AWS private network - rather than having to go through the internet.

There are 2 types of VPC endpoint:

**Interface Endpoints (powered by AWS PrivateLink)**
- Supports most AWS services
- Provisions an ENI (private IP) as the entry point which requires a security group.
- Has a cost, per hour and per GB of data sent.

**Gateway endpoints (only for S3 and dynamoDB)**
- Free!
- Used as a **target group in a route table**
- Usually the right choice for S3 or DynamoDB - only exception would be if accessing from another VPC or region or on-prem.
