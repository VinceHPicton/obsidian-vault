A firewall applied to an entire VPC, which under the hood uses [[Gateway load balancer (GWLB)|gateway load balancer]]  

It can **allow, drop or alert** traffic, and can inspect traffic from anywhere - other VPCs, the internet, site-to-site VPN traffic, direct connect 

Control traffic from layer 3 to layer 7.

It provides fine grained control, allowing you to inspect packets by:
- IP and ports
- Protocol used
- Stateful domains - eg only allow traffic out to mycorp.com
- Regex pattern match

Send logs to S3, cloudwatch, kinesis data streams

Use **AWS firewall manager** to apply to VPCs across accounts.
Provides **active flow inspection** for intrusion prevention.
