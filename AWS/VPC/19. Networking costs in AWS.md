General principles:
- Using the AWS private network where possible instead of the public internet is generally cheaper and faster
- Data ingress (into AWS) is free
- Data egress is not free, therefore minimise it where possible.
- Data transfer within an AZ is often free
- Data transfer within a region is cheaper than cross regions.

**If many EC2s or other services are communicating/sending data - it will be best to keep them all within a single AZ**

- **Dont query large amounts of data to compute with outside of AWS when you could perform the compute inside AWS and not pay for egress.**
- **If using [[14. Direct Connect (DX)]] choose an AWS Direct connect location co-located in the same region as the services being connected to**

**S3 pricing per GB**
0.09 USD (9 cents) per GB egress
Additional 0.04 - 0.08 for transfer acceleration (speeds up GB/s by 50 - 500%)

0.085 USD (8.5 cents) egress **from cloudfront edge locations** - also provides caching reducing read costs - no brainer

0.02 USD per GB for cross region replication - so maybe only so this for hyper important data


**Following the use private AWS network theme - use [[11. VPC Endpoints|VPC endpoints]] NOT the public internet, to contact AWS services from inside a VPC.**
Gateway endpoints are free! Interface gateway is still much cheaper.
