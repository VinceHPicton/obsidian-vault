Direct connect is one of the 2 ways for you to make a connection from a corporate data centre to AWS.
This way creates a **private** connection to AWS.
Since it is not over public internet it **is not encrypted**, but you **can add encryption** if you want. Supports IPv4 and IPv6.
It often takes **over 1 month** to set up a direct connection

You can use this connection to **access private EC2 instances, or public resources like S3.**

**Why might you use this?**
- It's faster! (not sent over public internet) => Increase bandwidth throughput eg if working w large dataset
- More consistent network as not reliant on the internet
- To connect up hybrid environments.

To establish this you need to use an **AWS Direct Connect *Location*** these are actual physical locations. Within these you need an **AWS Direct connect** ***endpoint*** and also a customer/partner router, which will relay traffic from the customer router/firewall at the corp data centre. The VPC must have a virtual private gateway (VGW)

**Direct connect gateway**
This is a networking feature that allows you to connect multiple VPCs in different regions to a single Direct Connection. This is specifically for where you have multiple VPC and an on-prem external network to connect with.

**DX connection types**

1. Dedicated connections - 1 Gb/s - 10 Gb/s - 100 Gb/s
- A physical ethernet port dedicated to the customer
- You must request it with AWS first, and then AWS direct connect partner.

2. Hosted connections - 50 Mb/s - 500 Mb/s - 10 Gb/s
- Connections are made via direct connect partners
- Add or remove capacity on demand

**Resiliency**
You can achieve **high resiliency** through a **single connection** to each location.
But to achieve **maximum resiliency**, you need to make **multiple separate connections** to the same location.

For a cheaper alternative, use a [[13. Site to Site VPN, VGW CGW|Site to site VPN]] as a backup connection!
