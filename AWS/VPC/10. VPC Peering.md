VPC peering allows you to connect different VPC across AWS accounts or across regions and make them behave as if they were in the same network.
It's important that the CIDR ranges do not overlap from the different VPCs (otherwise 1 IP could lead to 2 places).
You can reference a security group in a peered VPC (which is in the **same region**) allowing us to give a source as that SG rather than a CIDR range for a [[9. NACL]]. Like this:
