What is a [[VIF]] (virual inteface)? A VIF is a **logical network connection**, this means it's defined in the software, it's not a physical connection like a cable would be.

In AWS a VIF can be public, private, or transit.

You must create a VIF to use a direct connect connection.

To connect to a virtual private gateway in AWS, you would use a private VIF, which would use private IP addresses.

A public VIF can be used with DX to connect to public resources, using their public IPs
