Internet gateways (IGW) can be attached to a VPC to provide a **route** for outbound and inbound internet traffic. 

- IGWs are created outside of the VPC, and then attached to a VPC.
- An IGW can only be attached to a single VPC
- And a VPC can also only have a single IGW

If a subnet has routes in its route table to an IGW, it is a **public subnet** - traffic from the internet can target the IP of devices in the subnet (as long as other security rules allow), and traffic from the instances can get to the internet via the gateway.
