Site to site VPN is one of the 2 ways for connecting on-prem data centres to your AWS VPC. The connection is over the public internet but encrypted (this is what a VPN is).

To create a site to site VPN you must :
**Create a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) on your VPN**
- This is a VPN "concentrator" on the AWS side
- You create an attach it to the VPC

**Install a customer gateway (CGW)**
- This is some software or a physical device at the customer side outside AWS.
- Think of it as handling the encryption for the user.

**Exam questions on this**

*What IP adddress to use to reach the customer gateway?*
- The public internet routable IP of the customer gateway device
- UNLESS it's behind a NAT device enabled for NAT traversal, in which case you need to aim it at the IP of the NAT device

*Important step: enable route propagation for the VPC gateway in the route table associated with subnets is required to allow traffic to the VPN.*

*If you need to ping your EC2 instances from the on-prem location, you must allow ICMP protocol (ping protocol) on inbound of security groups*

**AWS VPN CloudHub**
This allows you to use AWS site to site VPN to connect different on-prem networks together by having multiple connections to your virtual gateway - a hub and spoke model which is low cost.
You just connect many customer gateways to your VGWs and setup dynamic routing and route tables.
