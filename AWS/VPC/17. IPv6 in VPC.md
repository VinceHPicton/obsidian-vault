You can enable [[IPv6]]  for your VPC by adding an IPv6 CIDR range, but you **can never disable IPv4**

If you do this your instances will receive at least:
- 1 public IPv6
- 1 private IPv4

They can use either of these to communicate with the internet via an internet gateway.

For exam:
remember that you cannot disable IPv4, so if you are unable to create a new Ec2 in your subnet, it ill never be because you ran out of IPv6 as there are so many, it will mean you will need to allocate a new IPv4 CIDR range to the subnet.
