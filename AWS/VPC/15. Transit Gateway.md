Transit gateway exists to solve the problem of having many different VPCs requiring a complex web of peering connections and direct connect links.

It is a managed **network hub** allowing you to connect thousands of VPCs, on-prem networks and [[14. Direct Connect (DX)|DX]] connections through a single central gateway (hub and spoke model). It can connect VPC **across regions** and **across accounts**. 

- **Route tables** exist for a transit gateway, to determine which VPC can talk to eachother.
- Transit gateway is the **only service which supports IP [[IP|multicast]]**


**Transit gateway use case: increase the bandwidth of Site-to-site VPN using ECMP**
ECMP = equal cost, multi-path routing.
With transit gateway, **2 or more separate tunnels are always** used to connect a VPN connection. This gives additional throughput, the Transit gateway load balances across the connections.
Each tunnel provides 1.25 Gb/s of throughput, so t**ransit gateway provides a total of 2.5 Gb/s** at minimum.
However, further tunnels can be added to give even more throughput!
