These capture information about IP traffic going to and from **instances within** your VPC
This is different to [[16. Traffic mirroring|traffic mirroring]] which copies traffic by watching a single source.

There are
- VPC Flow Logs
- Subnet Flow Logs
- [[ENI (Elastic network Interface)]] flow logs

You can send logs to S3, CloudWatch or Kinesis Data Firehose

Troubleshooting SG vs NACL issues, remember that SGs are stateful, so if a request was allowed out but not in or vice versa, it's NACL.
