These are where you literally rent a server rack which is sent into your data centre from AWS, and runs many of the standard AWS services, like S3, EC2, EKS etc.

It's kinda like having a tiny AZ in your own data centre, but you now have the responsibility of keeping that outpost secure.

**Why do this?**
To manage your on-prem and cloud services (if using hybrid cloud) requires 2 different skill sets. So what if your on-prem used the exact same interface as the cloud?

Now you can manage your on-prem server racks with the same APIs and skillset that you manage your cloud infrastructure.
