Authentication/auth token swapping through AWS

You have user pools of 2 types:

**Cognito user pools**
- This for letting users login/authenticate with to your apps
- Can integrate with **API gateway** and **ALB**
- Able to **login with Facebook** or other credentials

**Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Identities)**
- For giving users direct access to aws resources, eg a private S3 bucket
- The users here can actually be defined in Cognito user pools!
	- You login and get token from User pool, or facebook login etc if successful
	- You then exchange that token for temp AWS credentials and are assigned an IAM role
	- Now you can use those credentials to access a **private AWS resourcce**
- IAM policies that the credentials provide are defined inside cognito and can be customized based on user_id
- You can create default IAM roles for authenticated or guest users incase they dont have a specific defined role.

**Cognito vs IAM** These terms mean Cognito in exam:
"hundreds of users"
"mobile users"
"authenticate with SAML"


**Key points for exam:**
- Cognito is used to create user base for web and mobile app
- You can use it to **enable row level security in dynamoDB** for fine grained access: give user access to read/edit only records with specific ID prefix for example
- Cognito user pools integrate directly with API gateway or Application Load Balancer.
