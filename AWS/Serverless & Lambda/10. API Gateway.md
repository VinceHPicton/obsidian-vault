**API Gateway Endpoint types**

Edge-Optimized (default)
- API gateway still exists in the region it was created at but it's accessed performantly at edge locations

Regional
- Where you wont need edge caching globally
- Can still use CloudFront to manually control caching locations

Private
- Only accessible from within the VPC using an [[ENI (Elastic network Interface)]]
- Use resource policies to allow access.

**API Gateway security**
User auth:
- IAM roles for internal apps
- Cognito for user auth - like mobile users
- Custom auth logic

Custom Domain Name HTTPS
*Integrate with ACM for HTTPS*
- If using edge-optimized - the certificate must be in **us-east-1**
- If regional - the cert must be in the same region as the gateway
- Must setup CNAME and Alias record in Route 53
