You can build a visual workflow which orchestrate logic - literally a flow diagram of a complex series of actions, this could be invoking lambdas, calling EC2, SQS etc...

Possible to also incorporate human interaction in the flow.

Might use it for order fulfilment, processing data, web apps, any other workflw
