A CloudWatch metric is a variable you can monitor like NetworkPacketsIn for EC2, there are loads of metrics and they exist for all different services.

- Metrics belong to **namespaces** - you have 1 namespace per service basically
- A **dimension** is an attribute of a metric - eg instance ID - and you can have up to 30 per metric, and you can also **create your own** (RAM use is a key example)
- Metrics have **timestamps**
- You can create **dashboards** of your metrics


**You can also stream your metrics to another destination**
With near-real time delivery, can also filter metrics to see a subset in stream.
