AWS Config is **per-region** (no free tier) service that **continuously monitors, records, and evaluates** the configurations of your AWS resources.

**Primary use cases**
- Configuration assessment of resources
- Compliance
- Security

AWS Config works by **evaluating rules** such as "does any EC2 have an open port 22 in a public VPC"
These rules **cannot prevent** anything from happening on their own, they just notify via **SNS, EventBridge** etc.

Rules can be evaluated
- For a config change
- At regular intervals

You also pay per rule eval and it can get expensive

**Remediations**
While the rules themselves cant prevent stuff, you can use an SSM automation document to automatically fix it if a rule is violated. You can also set **remediation retries** is the fix didnt work.
