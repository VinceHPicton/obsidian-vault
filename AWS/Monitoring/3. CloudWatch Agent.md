By default EC2 does not send any logs to cloudwatch - it stores them on the EC2 disk.

You need to run a **cloudwatch agent** (a piece of software) on your EC2 to push any logs you want.
This software can also be setup on on-prem servers.
It can collect **logs and metrics**, such as
- CPU
- Disk (free, total, IO etc)
- RAM
- Netstat (TCP/UDP connections etc)
- Processes
- Swap Space


CloudWatch agent is also referred to as unified cloudwatch agent, because of the deprecated cloudwatch logs agent - which can only send logs.
