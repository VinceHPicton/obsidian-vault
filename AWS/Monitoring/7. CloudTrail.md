This is on by default and is basically like a changelog for your AWS, it provides a history of all actions performed within your AWS account by any means - console, CLI, SDK, other services.

You can apply a trail to all regions (default setting) or a single region.
You can put the logs into cloudwatch logs or S3

**Event types**

Management events:
- Read and Write events performed **on your AWS resources**
	- Write events modify resources in some way, reads do not

Data events:
- By default these aren't logged because the volume is so high, but eg putting an object in a bucket is a data event.


**CloudTrail Insights events**
This is a service you can pay for which analyses your CloudTrail events automatically and flags anything unusual.
It does this by watching **management events** over time to see what normal activity looks like for your account.
After this it will analyse **write events** (as only these really matter that much) and create an Insight event if something unusual happens.

**Event retention**
Event retained for **90 days**.- if you want longer save them to S3.
