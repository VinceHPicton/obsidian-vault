**Respond** to almost **any event** that happens in AWS, or **schedule** things to happen with cron jobs

Examples:
- Send an email if someone logs into root user
- Every hour trigger a lambda

**EventBridge consists of rules**
A rule defines:
- When the event should run (if X happens) or if on a schedule what that schedule is
- What the targets are (default or some other event bus, another service like lambda)

**The event buses**
- The default event bus is where events from aws services are sent
- The partner event bus can receive events from AWS partners lime datadog
- There is also custom event bus which can reveive events from a custom app.

You can access an event bus from another AWS account using a **resource-based policy**, to aggregate events from many accounts for example. Without a resource-based policy only the event bus owner can send events to the bus.

You can archive events sent to the bus, and replay archived events.

**Schema registry**
Allows you to generate code for your apps that will respond to events.
