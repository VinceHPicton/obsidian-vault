Alarms are used to trigger a notification or action based on a specific [[1. CloudWatch metrics|metric]]

**Alarm states**
- OK
- INSUFFICIENT_DATA
- ALARM
**Alarm period** (seconds) = How often the metric is checked to trigger alarm.


**CloudWatch alarm targets**
There are 3 main targets that be affected if an alarm goes off:
- EC2 => trigger termination, stop etc
- AutoScaling group => scale up/down
- SNS => notify developer or do anything else

**Composite alarms**
These are alarms which trigger based on a group of other alarms, for example you might trigger a notification only if network is low but CPU usage is high on your EC2.
- They can be done with AND or OR - eg alarm 1 AND alarm 2 sounds => sound alarm
- They are used to reduce alarm noise.


**EC2 instance recovery**
There are status checks you can do on your EC2s, Instance, system, EBS statuses.
If an alarm triggers a recovery, the new EC2 will keep the same **IPs** (public , private, elsatic), metadata.


**You can use the CLI to manually trigger an alarm and check what happens**
