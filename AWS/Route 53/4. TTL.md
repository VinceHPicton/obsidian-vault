Records time to live.

- The client (trying to reach www.example.com) requests the IP of the site from the DNS server - in this case route 53.
- It will then cache the TTL by however long route 53 tells it to, eg 300 seconds.
- Client will not request the IP from DNS again until TTL expires.
- **TTL is mandatory for all DNS records except for Alias records**
- High TTL - eg 24 hours, results in less traffic to route 53 but potentially more outdated records
- Low TTL - eg 60 sec - very rarely outdated records, high traffic to DNS
