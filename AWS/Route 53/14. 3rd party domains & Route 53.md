A domain registrar = some org you can buy domains from
A DNS service = a service that translates domain names into IP addresses and manages DNS records for your domains.

A domain registrar usually comes with DNS services though, so it's confusing.

**You can buy a domain from anywhere and still use it with route 53**

**To do this:**
1. Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53
2. Update the NS (name servers) addresses on the 3rd party website to use the Route 53 Name Servers
