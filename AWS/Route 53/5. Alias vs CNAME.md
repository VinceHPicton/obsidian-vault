In Route 53 Alias is an extension to DNS functionality, allowing you to map any domain **including a root domain** to the address of an AWS resource.

This is different to a [[2. Record types|CNAME]] record because a CNAME record **cannot map a root domain to something else**, only a subdomain to something else.
See [[Root vs sub domain name]] and [[1. What is DNS, URL]] for more info on root domains.

**Important**:
- **You cannot set the TTL in an Alias record, AWS does it for you.**
- Alias can map to many services like cloudfront, S3, API gateway, but you **cannot set an alias to map to an EC2 DNS name** this is because if you stop/start an EC2 it's IP address will change. Alias is specifically for managed services.
