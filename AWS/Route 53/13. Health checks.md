Health checks are main for public resources, but can be used for private.
You can use a healthcheck to trigger a failover for example.

*Types of healthcheck*

**Monitor an endpoint**
- About 15 global healthcheckers will monitor the health of your endpoint.
- The resoruce must allow the IPs of the healthcheckers - SG/firewall.
- Health checks pass if the endpoint responds with 2xx or 3xx
- If more than 18% of the checkers find it healthy, it's considered healthy.
- Able to choose which locations Route 53 should use.

**Calculated health checks**
Combine the results of many healthchecks, and configure whether the overall check should return healthy based on the aggregate results, can use AND NOT and OR checks.
- Monitor up to 256 healtchecks

**Private hosted zones**
Since the health checkers are not in your VPC, they cannot access your private resources to check them.
The only thing you can do is **create a health check which monitors a CloudWatch Alarm**
