Hosted zones are how to do [[DNS zones]] in AWS.

Basically if you have different sub domains like api.mywebsite.com and static.mywebsite.com you can route traffic to an IP or something from those addresses.

There are public and private hosted zones.

**Public**
Traffic from internet can hit these

**Private**
Route traffic within a VPC.

You might do this because your S3 bucket IP is not static.
