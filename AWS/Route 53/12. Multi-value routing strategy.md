Mutli-value allows you to return up to 8 healthy IPs per record.
The client will choose on of the record to connect to.
Simple also does this, but multi-value allows you to **use health checks** - simple routing may return unhealthy instances as it cant do this.

**NOT a replacement for an ELB** - because multi-value is **client side load balancing** whereas an ELB is server side.
