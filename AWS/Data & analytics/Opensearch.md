(formerly ElasticSearch) It's a managed search and analytics service, and is commonly used **alongside** your database.

Whereas in Dynamo you can only search by primary key or index, opensearch lets you **search any field**, and for **partial matches**.

Like redshift it comes as **clusters** which can be **provisioned or serverless**
