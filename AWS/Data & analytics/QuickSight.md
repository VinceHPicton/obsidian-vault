This is a data visualisation service kinda like intuitix was. **Serverless machine learning powered business intelligence dashboards.**
![[QuickSight.png|400]]

You can create users and groups (entirely separate from IAM users) to share the dashboards with.
A Dashboard is a read-only snapshot of some analysis

It can analyse data within your AWS or can also look at external data sources like jira.

If data is imported to QuickSight you can use the **SPICE engine** on it

You can also set up **column level security**
