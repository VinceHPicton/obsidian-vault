**Lex** (think aLEXa)
Is the tech that powers Alexa - it is **ASR** (automatic speech recognition) which converts speech to text.
This is used for building **chatbots** as it can understand the intent of callers - whole sentences etc


**Connect**
This is for building **virtual call centres** and can integrate with Lex, CRMs and lambda for example, to automate taking customer calls to book appointments.
It's 80% cheaper than traditional contact centres
