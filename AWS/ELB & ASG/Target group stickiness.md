Stickiness means that when a new user connects through the LB, after they are sent to a particular instance, they will then keep being sent back to that instance for some amount of time.
It's used so a user can maintain session data.

This only applies to [[Network load balancer (NLB)|NLB]] and [[Application load balancer (ALB)|ALB]] since [[Gateway load balancer (GWLB)|GWLB]] is *transparent*, and adding cookies would mean it is no longer invisible to the packets going through it.
It may bring imbalance to load, say if 1 user sends a lot of traffic. 

**How it works**
Cookies are attached to the packets
- Application-based cookies
	- Custom cookies - generated by the target (eg EC2 instance)
	- Application cookies - generated by the load balancer
- Duration-based cookies - generated by load balancer.
