Layer 4 load balancer allowing you to:
- Forward UDP & TCP traffic to instances.
- Ultra-fast
- Millions of requests per second.
- Not in free tier

So if you see, ultra fast, extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic, think network load balancer.

You can forward TCP incoming to HTTP.

**Health checks:** can use TCP, HTTP, HTTPS

**Target groups**
- EC2 instances
- **Private** IP addresses
- Application load balancers
