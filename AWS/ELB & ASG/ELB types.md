There are 3 types you need to know about
- [[Application load balancer (ALB)]] - HTTP, HTTPS, Websocket
- [[Network load balancer (NLB)]] - TCP, TLS, UDP
- [[Gateway load balancer (GWLB)]] - Operates at network layer 3 (network layer) - uses IP

The classic load balancer (old version) still exists but has been removed from the exam.
