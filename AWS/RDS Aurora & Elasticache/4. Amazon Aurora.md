- Proprietary AWS software (not open source) - it's highly available and scalable.
- **Postgres** and **MySQL** are supported as Aurora DB (meaning DB drivers from either work as if Aurora was Postgres/MySQL)
- Up to 15 read replicas - add them at a push of a button, or use scaling policies.
- Scales in 10 GB increments up to 128TB of storage **across the entire cluster**
- There is **1 single write endpoint**, pointing to the single master DB.
- There is also **1 single read endpoint**, which load balances across all the [[2. RDS read replicas and multi AZ|read replicas]].
- A little more expensive than RDS, but is much more performant than it.
- By default its within a region, but you can add read replicas to other regions and expand to cross-region too.
- Automatically copies data into 6 read replicas across 3 AZs (within its region)
	- 4/6 needed online for DB writes to be allowed
	- 3/6 for reads
	- Storage is spread across 100s of volumes

**Key info**
- Shared storage volume
- Replication
- Self healing
- Auto expanding
