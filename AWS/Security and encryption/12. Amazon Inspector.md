This is an automated tool for detecting vulnerabilities with **EC2**, **Lambda**, and **images** on ECR.

Like GuardDuty, you just turn it on and pay for it, and it finds vulnerabilities for you.

- It checks for **network reachability** on EC2
- and **checks against CVE** database (common vulnerabilities and exposures) for package vulnerabilities on all 3.
