Web Application Firewall is a **layer 7 (HTTP) firewall** used to protect your apps from common web exploits.

Where you can use WAF:
- Application Load Balancer (Not NLB as it's layer 7)
- API Gateway
- CloudFront
- AppSync GraphQL API
- Cognito user pools

**Web Access Control Lists**
You can define rules for your firewall:
- Allowed IP sets, 10k IPs per rule
- HTTP header/body rules
- SQL Injection and XSS attacks
- geo-match (block countries)
- **Rate-based** rules (DDoS protection)

Web ACLs are **regional** except for cloudfront
You can also combine rules into rule groups

**Use WAF to give [[Application load balancer (ALB)|ALB]] a fixed IP**
ALBs do not have a fixed IP, but combining a [[Global accelerator]] and a WAF, we can create a static IP ALB.
The WAF is used to ensure the only IP allowed is from the global accelerator, and the global accelerator **provides a fixed IP**
