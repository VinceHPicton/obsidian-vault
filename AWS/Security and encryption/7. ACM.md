ACM = AWS Certificate Manager
This is the service which manages your SSL/TLS certificates.
Public certificates are free to use in ACM, private ones arent.
Auto-renews your certs.

You can load the certs to any load balancers, cloudfront, API gateway.
But you cannot use it with EC2 directly.

**Requesting Public Certificates**
1. List domain names to be included in the cert
2. Select validation method: email or DNS (preferred)
3. Wait a few hours
4. Public cert enrolled for renewal with ACM

**Importing public certs**
- **Does not auto renew** if you do this
- sends events to eventbridge to warn of expiry
- AWS Config can detect expiry.

**Key point about [[10. API Gateway]] integration**
Because [[CloudFront]] exists in **us-east-1**, if you are using **edge optimized** API Gateway (the default) the ACM certificates **must exist in us-east-1**

If using regional - ACM must exist in the same region as the api gateway.
