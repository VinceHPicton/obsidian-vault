This is quite similar to parameter store, with the main difference that you can **force secrets to rotate** every X days
The main use case of this is for **RDS credentials** - one secret can contain several pieces of data
It's cool because if you update the DBuser/password the RDS itself is automatically updated.

**Multi-region secrets**
Just like with [[2. KMS multi-region keys]] there is a primary and multiple replicas of the secret that stay synced with the primary.
You can also promote a replica to a new standalone secret.

You'd use a multi-region secret if you had multi-region apps that needed the secret
