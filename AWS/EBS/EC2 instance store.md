- These are where your EC2 gets a hardware attached drive (not a network drive like EBS gives you).
- So there is no network latency and you get **very high performance**.
- This is good for things like caching.
- The problem is that when your instance is **stopped** (even stopped and restarting loses it) the EC2 instance store is gone forever. This is **ephemeral** = data only persists as long as instance is running.
