A fully managed, serverless **time series database**.

Will be far cheaper (1/10th) and far faster (1000x) than using RDS for time-series data.

- Store and analyse trillions of events per day
- Encrypted in transit and at rest
- Storage tiering automatically: recent data in memory, old data in cost-optimised storage
- SQL compatible, time scheduled queries for analytics
- Great for IoT
