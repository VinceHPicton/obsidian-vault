Infinitely scaling storage which can hold an static (unchanging) file (referred to as an object) you can think of.

**S3 buckets**
- Basically like root folders within s3, *objects* are the things in the bucket
- Name must be **globally unique** across all accounts in the world
- Exist in **one region**
- Buckets can also contain folders

**S3 objects (files)**
- All objects have a unique **key**, which is a full URL leading to the file, eg:
	- [https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name](https://bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com/key-name)
	- https://vp-19970320.s3.us-east.amazonaws.com/folder1/folder2/Dotty.jpg
- There is no *real* concept of directories within buckets, there are only key names that contain slashes
- Successful object upload gives a 200 OK HTTP code.
- Max size is 5TB
- If uploading more than 5GB file, you must use a "multi-part" upload


**Whats in an object**
- Key - the name of the object, a string
- Value - the data itself, a sequence of bytes
- Version ID - you can have versioning of an object
- Metadata - list of **text** key/value pairs, eg content-type, last-modified
- Tags - unicode key/value pair, up to 10 tags allowed

**Use cases**
- Backup and storage
- Archiving
- Disaster recovery
- Static websites
- Data lakes
