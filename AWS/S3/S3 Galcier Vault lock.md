Glacier has **vaults**, not buckets

You can apply a glacier vault lock policy which applies to all objects in the vault to prevent it ever being changed or edited in any way, this is generally used for compliance reasons

Allows you to adopt a WORM model (write once read many) - this just means read-only after its uploaded.
