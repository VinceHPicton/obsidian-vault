These are for **real-time** data processing, this is a key term to watch for in the exam.
The general use case for this is where many 1000s of tiny messages are being sent, eg by IoT devices
- Data retained for up to 365 days
- Data cannot be delete from kinesis
- Data ordering guarantee for data with same partition ID
- At-rest KMS encryption, in-flight HTTPS
- kinesis producer library (KPL) is sued to write producer apps
- kinesis client library (KCL) for writing consumer apps

There are 2 modes
**Provisioned**
For when you can reliably estimate your throughput needs, you choose a number of shards

**On-Demand**
AWS handles scaling for you.

**Data is broken up into** **shards**

A shard provides:
- 1 MiB/second and 1000 records WRITE
- and 2 MiB/second READ
